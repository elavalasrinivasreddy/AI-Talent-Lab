## Sprint 1 — What sales hits first (trust + front door)

*A prospect's path is: landing page → demo → security questions → invoice. Close gaps in that order.*

- [x] **Landing page + pricing page + demo-booking link** (F1) — done 2026-06-13; **folded into the SPA 2026-06-13** (decided: not a separate static site — avoids the ToS/Privacy content fork). Public routes now live in `frontend/src/components/Marketing/`: `/` → `LandingPage.jsx`, `/pricing` → `PricingPage.jsx`, shared `MarketingChrome.jsx` (nav/footer), styles in `src/styles/marketing.css` (globals.css tokens only). Router: `/` + `/pricing` are public (outside `PublicGuard`), catch-all now → `/`. Pricing tiers mirror `docs/product/03_roadmap.md` (Starter ₹0 / Professional ₹4,999 / Business ₹14,999) + founder-pilot callout. **Open:** swap `BOOKING_URL` mailto → Calendly (3 spots) in `MarketingChrome.jsx`; SEO is client-rendered (revisit prerender/SSR only if SEO becomes a channel).
- [x] **ToS + Privacy Policy pages** (F3) — done 2026-06-13 → `landing/terms.html` + `privacy.html`; copies served in-app at `/legal/*` (`frontend/public/legal/`); linked from apply consent screen, apply footer, career page, status page (`VITE_MARKETING_URL` switches links to the hosted site). **Open:** fill [PLACEHOLDERS] + lawyer review, then remove draft banners.
- [x] **Security one-pager** — done 2026-06-13 → [docs/product/07_security_one_pager.md](product/07_security_one_pager.md), claims code-traced against STATUS.md/RLS docs.
- [x] **Repo hygiene** (F8/E5) — done 2026-06-13. README/Postgres aligned, `.gitignore` hardened (`*.sqlite`, `uploads/`), tracked sqlite/chroma artifacts removed from the index.
- [ ] **Demo video (3 min)** from [DEMO_GUIDE.md](DEMO_GUIDE.md) — *deferred by decision 2026-06-13; plan later.*

## Sprint 2 — Make it chargeable + safe to operate (the "SaaS layer")

- [ ] **Plan & quota enforcement** (F2a) — plan field on org (`starter/professional/business/founder_pilot`), middleware checks: active positions, candidates/month, users. Pure code, no keys needed. *~2 days*
- [ ] **LLM spend caps per org** (F2b) — extend existing `llm_usage_logger` with a monthly budget per org + soft-warn / hard-stop. Closes the COGS risk from validation brief §5. *~1 day*
- [ ] **Razorpay adapter (simulation-first)** (F2c) — same adapter pattern as email: `BillingAdapter` with `SimulationBilling` now, `RazorpayBilling` activates when keys arrive. Invoice records + plan assignment work end-to-end in simulation. *~2 days*
- [ ] **CI pipeline** (E1/Q2) — GitHub Actions: pytest + lint on push, Playwright on PR. Makes every later checkbox durable. *~½ day*
- [ ] **`ENCRYPTION_KEY` generation + prod config docs** — self-generated, not externally blocked; documents the prod env (incl. X-Forwarded-For note). *~½ day*

## Sprint 3 — Code review queue (quality gaps)

- [x] **Fill the 5 stub test files** (Q1) — done 2026-06-13. All 5 written against verified endpoint contracts (auth-required + happy-path shapes for a fresh org; settings includes a create→list round-trip). First local run: 15 passed; remaining 11 were auth rate-limit (429) at fixture setup, not assertion failures — fixed by a session-scoped `disable_rate_limiter` fixture in `conftest.py` (no test asserts 429; this also hardens the existing suite against order-dependent throttling). **Run locally** (needs Docker for testcontainers Postgres): `pytest backend/tests/test_positions.py test_interviews.py test_talent_pool.py test_settings.py test_dashboard.py`.
- [x] **Kill the two DOM hacks** (E2/E3/D2) — bias-fix `window.acceptBiasFix` + injected HTML in `FinalJDCard.jsx:355` → React components; `window.prompt` in `PipelineTab.jsx:237` → existing `ConfirmModal`. *~1 day*
- [x] **Dead-file sweep** (E4) — done 2026-06-13 (bug log #231). Deleted `frontend/src/utils/candidates.py` (0-byte orphan) + `frontend/tests/example.spec.ts` (Playwright scaffold). **Kept `Dashboard/legacy/`** — confirmed *in use*: lazy-loaded by `DashboardPage.jsx` and rendered when `?legacy_dashboard=1` (escape hatch). `old_frontend/`/`old_backend/` not present in the working folder.
- [x] **First frontend unit tests** (Q3) — done 2026-06-13 (bug log #232, #233). `utils/api.test.js` (10 tests: auth header, 401, error normalization, `{data}`/204), `HireRequests/helpers.test.js` (relay state machine, labels, tone, formatters), `Dashboard/useDashboardData.test.js` (metadata-map contracts). Added `npm test` script. *Run on Node 20+: `cd frontend && npm test`.*
- [x] **Coverage floor** (Q5) — done 2026-06-13 (bug log #234). `pytest-cov` added; root `.coveragerc` (source=backend, branch, omit tests/migrations); `make coverage` enforces `--cov-fail-under=$COV_MIN`. **Floor not in `pytest.ini`** (so single-file runs don't fail spuriously). **Baseline measured: 37.54%** (132 tests); `COV_MIN` calibrated to **37**.
- [x] **`make e2e` script** (Q6) — done 2026-06-13 (bug log #235). `make e2e` → `scripts/e2e.sh`: boots uvicorn (`DEV_MODE=true`) + vite, waits for readiness, runs Playwright (self-seeds via `/dev/seed-core-loop`), tears down on exit. Also `make coverage`/`test-backend`/`test-frontend`.
- [x] **Service shim check** (E6) — done 2026-06-13 (bug log #236). Confirmed `position_service.py` + `hire_request_service.py` are complete thin facades (no logic); migration done. Docstrings updated to mark them intentional/stable so they aren't re-flagged. No behaviour change.
- [x] **Uploads dir gating** (E7) — done 2026-06-13 (bug log #237). `/uploads` static mount gated behind `SERVE_LOCAL_UPLOADS` (default true; set false in prod). Object-storage migration plan + pre-pilot checklist in `docs/architecture/uploads.md`.

## Sprint 4 — Built-but-unverified (QA the ⚠️ items) + small wins

- [x] **QA career-page branding** (Phase D#2) — done 2026-06-13 (code-trace QA; STATUS ✅). [qa doc](reviews/2026-06-13_sprint4_qa.md). 2 minor fixes applied (reset-to-empty, error toast).
- [x] **QA audit-log UI** (Phase D#7) — done 2026-06-13 (code-trace QA; STATUS ✅). Added Action filter (uses backend `action` param).
- [x] **QA team_lead dashboard** (Phase D#8) — done 2026-06-13 (code-trace QA; STATUS ✅).
- [x] **GDPR export UI** (Phase D#6) — done 2026-06-13. New `DataExportTab` (standalone SAR export by ID + talent-pool lookup, copy/download JSON); replaces the placeholder, wired in `SettingsPage`. STATUS ✅.
- [~] **Video intro apply-chat step + player** (Phase D#3) — built 2026-06-13 as a **post-submission add-on** (optional video offered at completion; recruiter player already live via `get_with_application`). Unit test `tests/test_video_intro.py` added. **Still ⚠️:** needs backend suite run + live walk (can't boot stack here).
- [x] **Onboarding first-run** (F5) — done 2026-06-13 (scaffold). New `OnboardingChecklist` (role-aware, progress bar, "publish your first job" primary step) wired into the empty dashboard. *Deferred:* seeded demo-org dev-tool (use `/dev/seed-core-loop`); per-step completion detection — finalize after first pilot.
- [x] **Design-token doc reconciliation** (D1) — done 2026-06-13. `design/00_design_system.md` token tables now match `globals.css` (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`); no code churn.
- [x] **A11y pass** (D4) — done 2026-06-13. Static axe/WCAG audit of apply chat + career page; 7 fixes applied (labels, dialog semantics, button names), open items (contrast, focus trap) logged in [a11y doc](reviews/2026-06-13_sprint4_a11y.md).

## ⛔ Blocked — needs external keys/accounts (do NOT start; revisit when credentials exist)

| Item | Blocked on | Prep already done |
|---|---|---|
| Google Calendar OAuth (real) | Google Cloud OAuth client | Mock adapter, schema columns, [guide](docs/integrations/calendar.md) |
| Candidate self-scheduling | Calendar above | — |
| WhatsApp outreach | Meta Business API approval | Roadmap #4; **start the application now — approval takes weeks** |
| Enrichment provider (Proxycurl/Apollo/Hunter) | Paid account | Adapter falls back honestly; or hide the toggle (allowed now) |
| Email DKIM/SPF live setup | Production domain | Runbook can be *written* now (Sprint 1 optional) |
| Razorpay **live** mode | Razorpay account/KYC | Adapter + simulation built in Sprint 2; **start KYC now — it takes days** |
| Naukri/LinkedIn APIs | Partner access | Phase 3; don't touch |
| Sentry prod DSN / prod env | Hosting decision | Code is no-op-safe already |

**Two things to kick off today even though they're "blocked":** Razorpay KYC and the WhatsApp
Business API application — both have multi-week lead times and cost nothing to start.

## Done log

*(Move finished items here with date + commit, so STATUS.md updates stay easy.)*

- **2026-06-13** — Sprint 1: landing site, ToS + Privacy drafts (in-app `/legal/*` + consent/footer links), security one-pager (`docs/product/07_security_one_pager.md`), `.gitignore` hardening, repo hygiene (sqlite/chroma untracked). STATUS.md F1/F3/F8 updated. Demo video deferred. *(commit: pending push)*
- **2026-06-13** — Sprint 1 (F1) **landing folded into the SPA** (was a separate static site): `/` + `/pricing` public routes in `frontend/src/components/Marketing/` (`LandingPage.jsx`, `PricingPage.jsx`, `MarketingChrome.jsx`, `styles/marketing.css`); router catch-all → `/`. Pricing mirrors roadmap tiers. JSX bundles clean via esbuild.
- **2026-06-13** — Sprint 3 (Q1): filled all 5 stub backend tests (`test_positions/_interviews/_talent_pool/_settings/_dashboard.py`) against verified contracts; `py_compile` clean, pytest pending local Docker run.
- **2026-06-13** — **Sprint 3 COMPLETE** ✅ (bug log #228–#238). Q1 stub tests + `conftest` rate-limiter fix; E2/E3 DOM hacks → React (ConfirmModal input; bias-fix event delegation — also repaired DOMPurify-stripped buttons); E4 dead-file sweep (kept in-use `Dashboard/legacy/`); Q3 frontend unit tests (`api.js`, `helpers.js`, dashboard metadata); Q5 coverage floor (**baseline 37.54% / 132 tests, `COV_MIN=37`**); Q6 `make e2e`; E6 service-facade docstrings; E7 `/uploads` gating + object-storage plan; plus #238 `utcnow()` deprecation. Local verification: backend 132 passed @ 37.54%, frontend `npm run build` clean. *(commit: pending push)*
- **2026-06-13** — **Sprint 4** (Phase D QA + small wins). **QA'd** career-page branding (#2), audit-log UI (#7), team_lead dashboard (#8) by full code-trace → STATUS ✅ ([qa doc](reviews/2026-06-13_sprint4_qa.md)); 2 CareerBrand fixes + AuditTab action filter. **Built** GDPR SAR export tab (#6, `DataExportTab`), onboarding first-run scaffold (F5, `OnboardingChecklist`), video-intro post-submission add-on (#3, `tests/test_video_intro.py`). **D1** design-token doc reconciled to `globals.css`. **D4** a11y pass — 7 fixes + findings doc ([a11y doc](reviews/2026-06-13_sprint4_a11y.md)). Verification: all touched JSX parse clean (acorn+jsx), backend edits `py_compile` clean. **Caveats:** no live stack in sandbox → QA is code-trace not click-through; video (#3) stays ⚠️ pending backend-suite run + walk. *Duplication note:* `old_backend/`/`old_frontend/` + 3 untracked root `test_*.py` are git-ignored/untracked clutter — remove on the dev machine (tooling here can't delete in the real folder). *(commit: pending push)*

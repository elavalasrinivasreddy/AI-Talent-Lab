# Bug Fixes & Adjustments Log

This document tracks all ad-hoc bug fixes, minor updates, and behavioral changes made during the testing phase. It includes the problem statement, the solution implemented, and the affected file paths.

## 1. Dev Console: True Global Reset

**Problem Statement:** 
In the Dev Console's "Global Mode" (no organization selected), clicking the reset buttons only deleted operational data (applications, positions, chat sessions). However, organizations, users, and departments were intentionally preserved. This made it impossible to completely wipe the database and start fresh for rigorous end-to-end testing without manual SQL intervention.

**Idea / Solution:** 
Updated the `reset_all_org_data` endpoint in the developer tools router. When `org_id` is passed as `None` (Global Mode), the endpoint now executes `TRUNCATE TABLE organizations CASCADE`. Because every business data table in the system is linked to `organizations` via foreign keys (as per project rules), the `CASCADE` command safely and instantly wipes **all** tables, giving the developer a completely blank slate. 

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routers/dev_admin.py` (Lines 272-296)
- `frontend/src/components/DevAdmin/DevAdminPage.jsx` (Modified in prior step to allow global trigger)

## 2. FastAPI Deprecation Warnings

**Problem Statement:**
The terminal was outputting `FastAPIDeprecationWarning: regex has been deprecated, please use pattern instead` during server startup and when hitting the dashboard endpoints.

**Idea / Solution:**
Updated the FastAPI `Query` parameter syntax in the dashboard router to use the modern `pattern=` keyword argument instead of the deprecated `regex=` argument.

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routers/dashboard.py` (Lines 42 & 108)

## 3. Dev Console: Org Dropdown Not Refreshing After Global Reset

**Problem Statement:**
After executing a true global wipe from the Dev Console, the database successfully cleared all tables. However, the organization dropdown at the top right of the Dev Console still displayed the list of old companies.

**Idea / Solution:**
The frontend was only fetching the updated row counts (`loadStats()`) after a reset but was failing to refetch the organizations (`loadOrgs()`). Updated `handleReset` in the React component to await a fresh fetch of organizations immediately after a reset, keeping the frontend state perfectly synced with the wiped database.

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/DevAdmin/DevAdminPage.jsx` (Line 106)

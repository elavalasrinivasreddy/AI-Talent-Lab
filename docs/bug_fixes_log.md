# Bug Fixes & Adjustments Log

This document tracks all ad-hoc bug fixes, minor updates, and behavioral changes made during the testing phase. It includes the problem statement, the solution implemented, and the affected file paths.

## 1. Dev Console: True Global Reset

**Problem Statement:** 
In the Dev Console's "Global Mode" (no organization selected), clicking the reset buttons only deleted operational data (applications, positions, chat sessions). However, organizations, users, and departments were intentionally preserved. This made it impossible to completely wipe the database and start fresh for rigorous end-to-end testing without manual SQL intervention.

**Idea / Solution:** 
Updated the `reset_all_org_data` endpoint in the developer tools router. When `org_id` is passed as `None` (Global Mode), the endpoint now executes `TRUNCATE TABLE organizations CASCADE`. Because every business data table in the system is linked to `organizations` via foreign keys (as per project rules), the `CASCADE` command safely and instantly wipes **all** tables, giving the developer a completely blank slate. 

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routers/dev_admin.py` (Lines 272-296)
- `frontend/src/components/DevAdmin/DevAdminPage.jsx` (Modified in prior step to allow global trigger)

## 2. FastAPI Deprecation Warnings

**Problem Statement:**
The terminal was outputting `FastAPIDeprecationWarning: regex has been deprecated, please use pattern instead` during server startup and when hitting the dashboard endpoints.

**Idea / Solution:**
Updated the FastAPI `Query` parameter syntax in the dashboard router to use the modern `pattern=` keyword argument instead of the deprecated `regex=` argument.

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routers/dashboard.py` (Lines 42 & 108)

## 3. Dev Console: Org Dropdown Not Refreshing After Global Reset

**Problem Statement:**
After executing a true global wipe from the Dev Console, the database successfully cleared all tables. However, the organization dropdown at the top right of the Dev Console still displayed the list of old companies.

**Idea / Solution:**
The frontend was only fetching the updated row counts (`loadStats()`) after a reset but was failing to refetch the organizations (`loadOrgs()`). Updated `handleReset` in the React component to await a fresh fetch of organizations immediately after a reset, keeping the frontend state perfectly synced with the wiped database.

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/DevAdmin/DevAdminPage.jsx` (Line 106)

---

## 4. Settings Page Crash (ReferenceError: disabled is not defined)

**Problem Statement:**
Navigating to the Settings page threw a fatal React error: `ReferenceError: disabled is not defined`. This crashed the entire page rendering, displaying the Vite ErrorBoundary overlay.

**Idea / Solution:**
In the left-rail rendering loop of `SettingsPage.jsx`, a stray check for `{disabled && ...}` was attempting to render a lock icon. Because it wasn't scoping to the mapped object (`item.disabled`), it threw a reference error. Updated the variable to correctly point to `item.disabled`.

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/Settings/SettingsPage.jsx` (Line 184)

---

## 5. Remove "General" Default Department

**Problem Statement:**
When a new organization registered, a default "General" department was automatically seeded. This forced users to delete it if it didn't fit their structure, as new orgs should start with a clean slate.

**Idea / Solution:**
Removed the default department creation step from the org seeding logic in the backend. New organizations now start with exactly zero departments.

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/services/settings_service.py`

---

## 6. Team Members UX Improvements & Pending Status

**Problem Statement:**
The Team members table had UI inconsistencies: The current user's role was rendered as raw text instead of a dropdown, the "Add User" modal was over-engineered with a password toggle, and invited users who hadn't accepted their invites yet falsely showed as "Active".

**Idea / Solution:**
1. Unified the Role column to always use a standard `<select>` (disabled for the current user) for better visual consistency.
2. Simplified the Add Member modal to only use the "Send Invite Email" flow, removing the password toggle.
3. Exposed `last_login_at` from the database. If a user has been invited but has never logged in, their status badge now cleanly displays as `⏳ Pending`.

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/db/repositories/users.py`
- `backend/routers/auth.py`
- `backend/services/auth_service.py`
- `frontend/src/components/Settings/tabs/TeamTab.jsx`

## 7. Crash in users.py during User Registration / Invite

**Problem Statement:**
When creating a new user or registering a new organization, the backend crashed at line 34 of `users.py`. This occurred because the `last_login_at` column (which was added to the `RETURNING` clause to enable "Pending" status for invites) was missing from existing local databases, throwing an `UndefinedColumnError`. 

**Idea / Solution:**
Added an incremental SQL migration (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`) for `last_login_at`, `failed_login_attempts`, and `locked_until` in `db/migrations.py`. This ensures that existing local databases automatically get the new columns on server startup without requiring a full database wipe. Additionally, added a safety check in `UserRepository.create` to raise a descriptive error if `conn.fetchrow` returns nothing.

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/db/migrations.py`
- `backend/db/repositories/users.py`

## 8. Hide Current User in Team Directory & Fix Registration Login State

**Problem Statement:**
The "Team Members" directory was displaying the current logged-in user, which is generally bad UX (users shouldn't accidentally deactivate themselves or edit their own role from a team management table; this belongs in a personal profile). Additionally, newly registered organization heads were showing up as "Pending" because their `last_login_at` timestamp wasn't being set during the initial registration automatic login.

**Idea / Solution:**
1. Filtered out the `currentUser` from the users array in `TeamTab.jsx` before rendering the table, effectively hiding the logged-in user from the Team directory.
2. Modified `AuthService.register` to explicitly call `UserRepository.reset_login_state` right after user creation, correctly setting their initial `last_login_at` timestamp.

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/Settings/tabs/TeamTab.jsx`
- `backend/services/auth_service.py`

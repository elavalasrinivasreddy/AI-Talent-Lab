## 3. Hire request — approval workflow

Newer surface (Phase 1 shipped 2026-05-19, approval layer added 2026-05-28).

**Shipped:**
- Dedicated `/api/v1/hire-requests/*` router (service + repository, transactions, audit log, tenant isolation)
- Frontend: `/hire-requests` list · `/new` wizard · `/:id` detail · `/:id/edit`
- dept_admin approval workflow with 4 email touchpoints (commit `44aff50`)
- Status flow: `pending → accepted/approved → fulfilled` plus `cancelled` / `rejected`
- Sidebar nav with pending-count badge; dashboard widgets via legacy `/positions/requests/*` shims

**Deferred (Phase 2):** see [`03_roadmap.md`](03_roadmap.md) and
[`design/pages/09_hire_request.md`](../design/pages/09_hire_request.md) for the full
Phase 1 vs Phase 2 split.

| WhatsApp | Phase 2 |
| Candidate self-scheduling | Phase 2 |

# Build Status — v3 Redesign Tracker

> Single source of truth for "what's redesigned vs not." Last updated 2026-05-30.
> Detail per surface lives in each [`design/pages/NN_*.md`](design/pages/) banner.
> Production hardening tracked in [`TECH_DEBT.md`](TECH_DEBT.md).
> Code review findings at [`review/code_review_findings.md`](review/code_review_findings.md).

Two axes per surface:
- **Feature** — does it work at all? (Live / Backend-only / Not built)
- **v3 redesign** — rebuilt to the v3 spec? (✅ Done / 🟡 Partial / ❌ Not started)

## Foundation (cross-cutting)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase A — design tokens (`globals.css`) | ✅ | Teal `#0D9488` + Plus Jakarta Sans tokens; all v3 pages consume via `var(--color-*)` |
| Phase B — shared atoms `Icon` / `Chip` / `Stat` / `RoleGate` | ✅ | Adopted across all redesigned surfaces |
| `StatusBadge` remap to v3 palette | 🟡 | Component exists; `constants.js` palette vs design-system palette not fully reconciled |
| Role gates in router | ✅ | `/chat` (hr+org_head), `/analytics` (org_head+dept_admin+platform_admin) gated via `RoleGuard` |
